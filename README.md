[SAP Cloud Platform Workflow](https://cloudplatform.sap.com/capabilities/product-info.SAP-Cloud-Platform-Workflow.df696e5a-d973-4ecd-8d8d-532d60aa1921.html) allows you to build, run, and manage workflows, from simple approvals to end-to-end processes that can span across different organizations and applications.
